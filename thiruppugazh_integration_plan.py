           - Use academic papers on Arunagirinathar's terminology
           - Reference classical Tamil dictionaries for verified epithets

           - Focus on well-known Thiruppugazh songs with available translations
           - Extract from published anthologies with meanings
           - Use existing scholarly compilations of Murugan names
        
        3. VERIFICATION PROCESS:
           - Cross-reference with multiple Tamil sources
           - Validate against traditional lexicons
           - Confirm devotional significance with scholars
        
        4. INTEGRATION PRIORITY:
           - Start with most common and well-documented names
           - Focus on names with clear Chaldean numerology potential
           - Prioritize names suitable for "Chaarvik" optimization
        
        5. INCREMENTAL BUILDING:
           - Add verified names gradually with full documentation
           - Maintain source authenticity and scholarly standards
           - Build comprehensive metadata for each name
